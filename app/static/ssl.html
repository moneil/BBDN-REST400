PYTHON and Self-signed certificates:
    To enable code to recognize the DVM self signed certificate you have to provide Python
    with the public Key 

    1. Start the DVM and ssh into it...
    $ vagrant up
    $ vagrant ssh
    2. Copy the keystore password from the config file
    $ cd /usr/local/blackboard/config
    $ more /usr/local/blackboard/config/bb-config.properties
        find the keystore password and copy it - you will use this in step 3 for 
        exporting the pem file
    3. Export the cert and keys 
    $ cd /usr/local/blackboard/config/keystores
    $ keytool -exportcert -alias tomcat -keystore tomcat.keystore -rfc -file /vagrant/keytool_crt.pem
    4. Make sure you can read the file:
    $ openssl x509 -in /vagrant/keytool_crt.pem -inform pem -noout -text
    4. copy the .pem file to a location your project can access it.
    5. update config.py to point to your .pem file
    6. add dev.bbdn.local to your hosts file and save:
        127.0.0.1	localhost dev.bbdn.local
    7. test access to to your DVM using dev.bbdn.local, if it doesn't work restart and retry

    now for all requests against your DVM the pem will be used to verify the server
    NOTE: that for production code you should change 'verify=CERTPATH' to 'verify=False' if 
    not using the server derived .pem file, or remove 'verify=...' completely if using 
    commercial certificates.

    SSL sessions in Python.
