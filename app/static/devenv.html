              <h1>REST Developer Environment Setup</h1>
              </br><p>The Blackboard Learn Developer Portal and Developer Virtual Machine (DVM) provide the foundation for 
                developing and testing REST integrations for Blackboard Learn.</p>
                <p>
                Developing REST applications requires additional tooling supporting 
                the delivery of the developed application. </p>
                <p>
                This section covers setting up the DVM and additional requirements for
                local development, testing, and deployment to production machines as used in this demo.
                </p>
                <p>
                This section will focus on the Developer Portal, DVM certificates, static IP addressing, and setting up the python environment

    <p>The Blackboard Developer Portal is the gateway to delivering your Learn REST applications.
    An account is not required to read about the APIs, however a Developer account is required to deploy REST applications.
    </p>
    </br>
    <p>
    <h4 id="regDevAccnt">Registering a Developer Account</h4>
    To register a Developer Account:
    <ol>
      <li>go to the <a href="https://developer.blackboard.com">Developer Portal</a> (https://developer.blackboard.com)</li>
      <li>click the 'Sign Up' button in the upper left corner of the portal page.</li> 
      <li>accept the REST Developers Agreement</li>
      <li>complete the registration form by filling in your contact information</li>
      <li>click submit</li>
    </ol>
    You now have a Blackboard Developer Account! Now you may register and manage your 
    applications using the 'My Apps' link at the top of the page.
    <h4 id="regAppRef">Registering an Application Reference</h4>
    Registering an application is just as easy - all you need to know is the application name.
    <ol>
      <li>go to the <a href="https://developer.blackboard.com">Developer Portal</a> (https://developer.blackboard.com)</li>
      <li>click the 'My Apps' link at the top of the portal page.</li> 
      <li>this applications page provides a list of the applications you have registered</li>
      <li>click the '+' icon to the upper left of the page - this will open the application registration dialog</li>
      <li>enter the name of your application, a description and click save.
      <li><strong>this is important!</strong> Copy the application key and secret and save them - these are required for authorizing your application using OAuth.
      <li>click continue</li>
      <li>your application is created and assigned an application ID - this is used by the Learn administrator to give your application access to their Learn instance.
    </ol>
    Congratulations! You have just created a Developer Account and registered an application!
    </p>
    <p>
    Now you need a Learn instance. We will be using the Developer Virtual Machine for this demo, but you may use any development Learn installation as long as it is a post-Q2 2016 Learn release.

    <h3 class="text-primary" id="DVM">Local Development Machines</h3>
    <h4 class="text-primary" id="DVM">The Developer Virtual Machine</h4>
    The Blackboard Learn Developer Virtual Machine (DVM) is a Vagrant image that allows you to run Blackboard Learn 
    in a virtualized environment such as Virtual Box. You may read about <a href="https://community.blackboard.com/docs/DOC-1104#comment-5260">
    how to install and use the DVM</a> on our Community Developers site.
    <p>
    When working with REST there are some additional considerations for your development environment and particularly the DVM.
    Notably, it is useful to have static IPs so that local VMs, e.g. one DVM and one app server, may co-exist and communicate to each
    other. This is accomplished by adding a network configuration to your Vagrantfiles and configuring the hosts file on your operating system and virtual machines. 
    You will need to know your private addressing. This will likely be either 10.0 or 192.168 addressing and can be discovered by viewing your operating system's network settings.
    </p>
    <p>
    <h4 id="staticIPs">Setting up Static IPs</h4>
    <h5>Vagrantfile</h5>
    Vagrant provides the means to assign a static IP to the virtual machine it manages. This is done by
    editing the Vagrantfile and adding <code>config.vm.network :public_network, ip: "10.0.0.101"</code>
    to the config section. You may place this near the end of the file before the final line containing 'end':
    <pre><code>
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  ...
  config.ssh.password = "vagrant"
  ...
  config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 5432, host: 9879
  config.vm.network :public_network, ip: "10.0.0.100" # above other devices on my private network
end</code></pre>
    </p>
        <h4 class="text-primary" id="DVM">REST Server Virtual Machine</h4>
    <p>While you can avoid setting up a REST server VM by leveraging a WSGI server - Python offers 
      several options (this demo uses Werkzeug for testing and Gnunicorn for the local REST VM and Heroku), 
      you may find it useful as to have a test environment that emulates your final production system. 
      There are several freely available Vagrant images to choose from (search for "free vagrant boxes"). You may use the following Vagrantfile for creating a Vagrant VM REST application server:
<pre><code># -*- mode: ruby -*-
# vi: set ft=ruby :

Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
    config.vm.provider :virtualbox do |vb|
    vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--memory", "4096"]
  end
  config.ssh.password = "vagrant"
  config.vm.box = 'wily-server-cloudimg-amd64-vagrant-disk1.box'
  config.vm.box_url = 'https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/vagrant/wily/20160706/wily-server-cloudimg-amd64-vagrant-disk1.box'
  config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 80, host: 7780
  config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 5000, host: 7750
  config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 2221, host: 7740
  config.vm.network :public_network, ip: "10.0.0.101"
end
</code></pre>
The .box file will be downloaded when you enter <code>$vagrant up</code> to start the VM.</p>
    <p>
    Now that the VMs are set to use static IPs you may address them via the IP, but you can address it by name if you
    add them to your hosts file. This is particularly useful if you are using certificates bound to the VM's hostname.
    The DVM uses "dev.bbdn.local" so that is what we will use here.</b>
    The above REST VM uses "vagrant-ubuntu-wily-64".
    </p>
    <p>
    <h4 class="text-primary">Hosts file</h4>
    To access the VMs from your system by name you need to add their IP:hostname pairs to your operating systems hosts file.
On OSX edit your <code>/private/etc/hosts</code> file and restart:</p>
<p>
<pre><code>##
127.0.0.1       localhost
255.255.255.255 broadcasthost
::1             localhost
#my vms
10.0.0.100      dev.bbdn.local
10.0.0.101      vagrant-ubuntu-wily-64</code></pre></p>
<p>On Windows you may follow the instructions at <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/27350/beginner-geek-how-to-edit-your-hosts-file/">howtogeek.com</a></p>
<p>Making similar entries in the hosts files on the VMs will allow the VMs to communicate.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-primary" id="lrnConfig">Configuring Learn for your REST Application</h3>
    REST is enabled on Learn by default but for security purposes only Learn Admin 
    registered applications will respond to REST requests.
    </p>
    <p>
    Instructions for Learn Administrators is located in the 
    <a href="https://community.blackboard.com/docs/DOC-1580">Managing REST Integrations in Learn</a> document on the Blackboard Community site.
    </p>
    <p>
    In brief the Learn Administrator creates a REST Integration using the REST Integrations tool using the 
    applicationID for your application - available on the Developer Portal on the My Apps page.
    The Learn Administrator will also need to create a User as which the application will run. This User's role 
provides the necessary entitlements for REST API access. (see <a href="https://community.blackboard.com/docs/DOC-1733">The Blackboard REST API Framework</a>)
    </p>
    </br>
    <p>
    <h3 class="text-primary" id="bbdnREST400">Using <i>this</i> Application</h3>
    There are a few options for using this application - you can:
    <ul>
      <li>view it at https://bbdn-REST400.herokuapp.com: just visit the site and play.</li>
      <li>install it on your own heroku site: see the Super Quick link on the index page.</li>
      <li>run it locally.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="text-primary" id="DVM">Running BBDN-REST400 locally</h4>
    There are a few steps that need to be completed in order to run this app locally. 
    The following should get you going presuming you have already performed the steps necessary to provide
    a test Learn instance e.g. the Developer Virtual Machine, and registered an application on the Developer Portal.
    <ol><li><h5 id="gtc">Get the Code</h5>
    The code is available on github and may be downloaded from https://github.com/moneil/bbdn-rest400. 
    </li>
    <li>
    <h5 id="spe">Setting up your Python Environment</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>make sure you have Python 2.7.11 installed.</li>
      <li>using a terminal:
        <ul>
          <li>cd to the project directory</li>
          <li><code>run $pip install -r requirements.txt</code></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <h5 id="sle">Set up your Learn Environment</h5>
    Using the applicationId create a REST Integration as outlined above. Asign your created User a Role with 
    the following privileges:
    <ul>
      <li>course.configure-properties.EXECUTE >> Course/Organization Control Panel (Customization) > Properties</li>
      <li>course.user.VIEW >>	Course/Organization Control Panel (Users and Groups) > Users</li>
      <li>system.user.course.enrollment.VIEW >> Course/Organization Control Panel (Users and Groups) > Users</li>
      <li>system.user.VIEW >>	Administrator Panel (Users) > Users</li>
    </ul>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
    <h5 id="ra">Running the Application</h5>
    The easiest way to run the application locally is to open a terminal and:
    <ul>
          <li>cd to the project directory</li>
          <li><code>run $python run.py</code></li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        This starts the application using the bundled werkzeug wgsi. note that editing the source will cause werkzeug to restart.
        Any runtime errors are printed in both the terminal and the browser, and the application dumps some debug information into the terminal.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may also set up a separate wgsi comaptible http server such as Gnunicorn or Apache (requires mod_wsgi).
